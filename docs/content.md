Hello, I’m Linda Mutesi!

For more than fifteen years, I have been lucky to be a part of passionate community builders in Uganda that nurture creativity, innovation and opportunity. My journey has taken me across diverse fields—supporting talent development, championing the visual arts, mentoring youth and women-led startups and advocating for things I believe.

A trained lawyer and Partner at Adalci Advocates, I serve on several boards as Director, Co-Founder and Patron. My interests span the visual arts, women led business, African literature, youth enterprise and interrogating African philanthropy. At the heart of it all is a commitment to social justice, reflective culture and the power of creative expression to bring people together.

Through The Bold Woman Fund, we work with Ugandan women entrepreneurs in fashion and design, offering training and retail opportunities at Bold in Africa, a store dedicated to showcasing exclusively made-in-Africa brands. This initiative is a product of the belief that women are the backbone of our societies and skilled women multiply resources across spaces

Currently, I am pursuing a Master’s degree in Philanthropic Studies at the University of Kent in the UK. Beyond my professional life, I am a mother of two teenage boys, a curious reader and an enthusiastic participant in spaces that question, teach and grow the mind.

Alongside my personal and professional journey, I have been fortunate to contribute to a range of initiatives that reflect my passion for community building, creativity and social change. At 32 Degrees East, where I am a Trustee and Board Member since 2018, I work with the centre’s leadership to bolster contemporary art practice in Uganda. As the outgoing Board Chairperson of Taala Foundation, I supported the organisation’s the leadership with strategy in their work that centers mental health awareness and creative therapy for sexual minorities, an area of life that is often overlooked yet vital for community well-being.

In 2022, I co-founded the FG Foundation, a platform dedicated to interrogating African philanthropy and community building. At The Citizen Report–Uganda, which I founded in 2021, we encourage civic participation and amplify citizen voices in governance and social justice. 

With both the Bold Woman Fund and Bold in Africa, we continue to work with women entrepreneurs and African-made brands, ensuring that local creativity has both visibility and opportunity. Beyond these, I have served as a Governor at 7 Hills International School….(dates) supporting educational excellence, and as Director and Secretary at FundiBots Ltd since ….., an organization that equips young people with practical science and robotics skills for the future. 


Looking ahead, my vision is to see each of these initiatives grow in sustainability and impact over the next decade. Together, they embody the values I hold close: empowerment, creativity, justice, and the belief that communities thrive when opportunities are shared.

This blog is where I bring these journeys together. Here, you’ll find personal reflections on my work as a lawyer, philanthropy student, and community collaborator; behind-the-scenes insights into the projects I am part of; and conversations with fellow creatives who are making a difference in their fields. At its core, this space is about storytelling—the kind that uplifts, challenges, and connects us.

I believe deeply in the transformative power of art: its ability to change lives, expand perspectives, and bridge communities. My hope is that through these stories and reflections, you’ll not only glimpse the work I do but also discover the wider beauty of human expression and connection.

I invite you to join me on this journey. By signing up for my newsletter, you’ll receive personal stories, creative insights, and updates on projects that joy my heart. 

With warmth,
Linda Mutesi
