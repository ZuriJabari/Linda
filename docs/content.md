Hello I am Linda Mutesi!

My Journey as a Community Builder

For 15 years, I've built communities supporting talent development, visual arts, youth and women startups, and marginalized groups. As a Ugandan lawyer and partner at Adalci Advocates, I serve on multiple Boards as Director, Co-Founder, and Patron.

I mobilize resources across various impact areas: visual arts, women in business, African literature, youth enterprise, and African philanthropy. I champion social justice, reflective culture, creative expression, and philanthropic support for causes I value.

Through The Bold Woman Fund, I support Ugandan women entrepreneurs in fashion and design with training and retail opportunities at my Bold in Africa Store, which exclusively features made-in-Africa brands.

Currently pursuing an MA in Philanthropic Studies at the University of Kent (UK), I'm also mother to two teenage boys. I enjoy reading and participating in cultural events and conversations.
